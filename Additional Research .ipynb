    "<b>soft</b> - 50818 (Good)- Soft water is surface water that contains low concentrations of ions and in particular is low in ions of calcium and magnesium. Soft water naturally occurs where rainfall and the drainage basin of rivers are formed of hard, impervious and calcium-poor rocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>salty</b> - 4856 (Salty) - Seawater is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of approximately 3.5%, or 35 parts per thousand. This means that for every 1 litre (1000 mL) of seawater there are 35 grams of salts (mostly, but not entirely, sodium chloride) dissolved in it. \n",

    "<b>unknown</b> - 1876 (Unknown) - NA \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>milky</b> - 804 (milky)- milky or white water is likely due to trapped air or a build-up of dissolved particles in the water pipes \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>coloured</b> - 490 (coloured) - Dissolved and particulate material in water can cause discoloration. Slight discoloration is measured in Hazen units (HU) Impurities can be deeply colored as well, for instance dissolved organic compounds called tannins can result in dark brown colors, or algae floating in the water (particles) can impart a green color.\n",
