# Phase-3-Final-Project EDA  

For the data in the project there were 41 columns describing 59,400 unique enteries. The dataframe was inspected and columns were grouped by category. Then each column was inspected & conclusions & insights listed. Due to the large nature of the data set the notebooks have been subdivided, order correlates with the number assigned before the notebook name.
